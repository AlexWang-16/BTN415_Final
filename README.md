**Group**: 2

# Usage

## Additional notes
Simulator by default listens for commands on port 27000 and transmits telemetry
data on port 27501.

If you wish to change the IP address, and port numbers, you will need to specify
them at launch via command prompt

The syntax is: `simulator.exe <IP Address> <Port for Command> <Port for Telemtry>`
